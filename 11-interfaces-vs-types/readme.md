# Types vs. interfaces

The difference between types and interfaces in TypeScript used to be more clear, but with the latest versions of TypeScript, theyâ€™re becoming more similar.

Interfaces are basically a way to describe data shapes, for example, an object.

Type is a definition of a type of data, for example, a union, primitive, intersection, tuple, or any other type.
